# Data-Driven-Decision-Making-in-SQL

In this folder the resolution of the DataCamp Case Study [Data Driven Decision Making in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-driven-decision-making-in-sql) can be found.

This project is based on a case study about an online movie rental company with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more. 

SQL queries are applied to study for example customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development.
